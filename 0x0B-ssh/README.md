# 0x0B. SSH
## Background context:
- This project involves managing an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server located in a remote datacenter. Unlike level 2, access is via SSH using an RSA key, enhancing security.
- The server is configured with the RSA key generated in a previous project's first task, stored in your intranet profile.
- Connect via SSH using the provided IP address and username. Remember, security is ensured through RSA key authentication.

- Happy coding !
