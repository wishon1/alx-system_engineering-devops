* Project: 0x06. Regular expression

* Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
[Regular Expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)
[regexp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp)
[Ruby: rubular](https://rubular.com/)
[PHP/Javascript/Python:](https://regex101.com/)

* Background Context
