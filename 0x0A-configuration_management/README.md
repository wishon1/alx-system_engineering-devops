# 0x0A. Configuration management

## Configuration Management with Puppet

This repository contains Puppet manifests for tasks related to configuration management. The tasks are designed to familiarize users with basic Puppet syntax and best practices.

## Background

The inspiration for this project comes from a real-world incident experienced by Sylvain Kalache while working on an auto-remediation tool named Skynet at SlideShare. A bug in the code led to unintended consequences, emphasizing the importance of robust configuration management tools like Puppet.
